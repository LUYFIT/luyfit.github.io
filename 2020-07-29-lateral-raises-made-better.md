<h1>Lateral Raises - Made Better</h1>		
		<p>The most effective way to grow your delts, is to take the shoulders to muscular failure in all its positions of flexion followed by adequate rest and recovery, as frequently as possible.</p>
<p>This requires effective* exercise selection - choosing the right exercises and sequencing them correctly in your program.</p>
<p>Truly 'effective' exercises take advantage of your body's leverages and mechanics to get the most* (stimulus) with the least* (wear on the joints and impact on recovery).</p>
<p>How can we take our shoulders to muscular failure then in the short* position of flexion where the fibres are most contracted?</p>
<p>We lean away!</p>
<p>Leaning away matches the peak contraction of the fibres with the hardest part of the lateral raise (dumbbell horizontal to the ground), allowing us to quickly and effectively reach muscular failure at the peak position.</p>
<p>More high threshold motor units are automatically recruited in the movement.</p>
<p>To perform the lean away lateral raise:</p>
<p>1.) Keep your feet together close to the base of the support, and suspend your body by gripping the pole with a straight arm.</p>
<p>2.) On the working arm, keep your wrist straight and elbow slightly bent.</p>
<p>3.) Raise the dumbbell from the lowest position up to horizontal, feeling a very strong contraction in your delts at the peak.</p>
<p>Some tips for the dumbbell lean away lateral raise:</p>
<p>1.) Consciously keep your shoulders DOWN to disengage your traps as much as possible.</p>
<p>2.) Make sure you are able to distinguish between muscle soreness vs. shoulder pain on this movement. I've had first hand experience of shoulder pain with swollen bursae in the past. Remember to avoid any sharp or very acute pain.</p>
<p>3.) If you experience issues, drop the weight and slow the movement down to ensure you prioritise STABILITY which keeps the head of the humerus (upper arm) right in the centre of the socket of your shoulder to avoid impinging on damaged structures.</p>
<p>Couple this movement with some other shoulder exercises in a well balanced, intelligent, progressive program to get the maximal amount of growth for those boulder shoulders!</p>
